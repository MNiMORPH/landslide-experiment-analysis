# landslide-experiment-analysis

Codes written to manage, analyze, and display data from autogenic landslides in the 2016--2017 sandbox experiments at SAFL.

* **Chronology:** Copies of key scripts used to semi-automate the generation of continuous and consistent time-series data from disparate experiment measurements and measurement types. The original repository may be found at https://github.com/witte199/Fluvial-Exp---Image-Rename, and the current organized and properly licensed version of this repository is at https://github.com/umn-earth-surface/fluvial-experiment-time-series-helper. This latter version is the version of record.

* **GrainSize** Contains and plots data on the grain-size distribution used in the experiment.

* **Landslides** Code to analyze and plot landslide geometries, chronologies, and derived relationships. This folder contains its own README with information on its contents.

* **Movies** *ffmpeg* commands to build movies of the experiment from the images; to be run in the folders containing the images, and will save the output in the next directory up.
